Supplementary Document for Aggregate Development Index (ADI)
This article establishes the need for a composite development index and describes the computation ofone such index using the results obtained in Bansal et al., where open-source satellite images that areavailable  at  frequent  intervals  and  offer  a  lesser  resource-intensive  alternative  to  ground  surveys  and  thecensus are used to predict socioeconomic development in Indian districts.Our target index is called Aggregate Development Index (ADI), recently coined by Bansal et al.  Wepropose a revised formula for the computation of this index to add dimensionality to its existing form, hencemaking it more homogeneous to the universally accepted indicator- the Human Development Index.
